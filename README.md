# Kwikreport
## Introduction
Kwikreport is a simple web app that aims to help weld inspection officers easily
generate a weld inspection report.
## Features
There are a lot of features incoming but we are putting our focus on the MVP for
now. The features we'll be building out in this version includes:
- Account creation and password management (nothing outside that for now under
account management).
- Ability to create, edit and delete reports.
- Ability to allow others view your reports (this will be via the web app).
- Finally, ability to export reports to spreadsheets format and download.

More features incoming...
